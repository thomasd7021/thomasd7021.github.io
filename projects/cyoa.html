                    <p> In this project I was paired with 2 other people. We needed to create a story and make markdown files that would be linked together. I worked with my partners to get this done. I added all the files and added the story to each file. I made sure that the files where all linked together proporly.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center">Reflection</h2>
                <p>We where given this promt so we could practice working with each other on git hub and parchtice pushing and pulling files from the repo. It was also so we could practice linking markdown files to other markdown files. There were many problems when doing this project, mainly no one did it. I was sick for a week when we started it and I didn't know what to do or who my partners where. One of my partners was out of the country for a month and the other one didn't do anything. Then the semester endded and in the next semester we were not in the same class so i had no communication with them face-to-face. When I reached out 2 weeks after it was due to ask if they could come to tutoring and no one replyed. Mr.Mueller asked them and they both said that they could come but one showed up and only stayed for 30 min. They didn't even do anything. I did all the files and added them to the repo and made sure that they all fit. If i did this again I would have asked the teacher what we were doing and looked at google classroom and got started on it when i was stuck at home from being sick. I would also have talked to the teacher more about my partners not doing stuff.</p>
