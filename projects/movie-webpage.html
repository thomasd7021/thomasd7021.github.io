            <p>We were tasked with making a website, using all the HTML and CSS that we learned of a movie that we made up.</p>
            <p>The wbpage needed to show that we knew how to code in HTML and CSS.</p>

            <h3> Content</h3>
            <p>With my partner we had a lot of fun making the webpage look funny. We added differnt backgrounds and even a nav bar that brings you to the "sequel" to the movie. We made the webpage about Duck McDuckieton and his friends. 
            The genres we decided on were comedy and fantasy with a little bit of horror which is most promanent in the sequel. We communicated even when I wasnt at school and created a good webpage.</p>
            <h3> Reflection</h3>
            <p>Throught the projects we had many problems some were with the coed not working and others were personal problems. One of these problems was me being sick for most of the project. I was struggaling with a migran and had truble focusing on the work most of the time, trialing off and playing around with the different colored backgrounds and images. I also wanst in school the last day of the project but we came up with a solution. In HTML you can write in comment tages <code><!-- --></code> which make it so the what you type dosent effect the code in any way. This is what we used to communicate when I wasnt there. We worked together on the last day to finish the movie page and did the whole sequal page.</p>
            <p></p>
