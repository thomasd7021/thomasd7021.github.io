            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <p>We were tasked with making a website, using all the HTML and CSS that we learned, of a movie that we made up.</p>
            <p>The webpage needed to show that we knew how to code in HTML and CSS.</p>
            <div class="row">

                
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <img src="../img/movie-wbpg.png" class="img-fluid project-img">
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p> This is the the <a href="https://movie-webpage.thomasd7021.repl.co/" target="_blank">final product.</a></p><br>
                    <p>This is the <a href="https://replit.com/@thomasd7021/movie-webpage" target="_blank">code</a> of the website.</p>
                </div>
            

            </div>
            <h3> Content</h3>
            <p>With my partner we had a lot of fun making the webpage look funny. We added differnt backgrounds and even a navigation bar that brings you to the "sequel" of the movie. We made the webpage about Duck McDuckieton and his friends. 
            The genres we decided on were comedy and fantasy with a little bit of horror which is most promanent in the sequel. We communicated even when I wasnt at school and created a good webpage.</p>
            <h3> Reflection</h3>
            <p>Throughout the project we had many challenges some were with the code not working and others were personal problems. One of these problems was me being sick for most of the project. I was struggaling with a migran and had truble focusing on the work most of the time, trialing off and playing around with the different colored backgrounds and images. I also wanst in school the last day of the project but we came up with a solution. In HTML you can write in comment tages <code><!-- --></code> which make it so the what you type dosent effect the code in any way. This is what we used to communicate when I wasnt there. We worked together on the last day to finish the movie page and did the whole sequal page. I also forgot how to change the backgrond color of some element which my partner helped me with.</p>
            <p>During the project I learned how to make a navigation bar and how to make different webpages on a website. These skills will be helpful in my upcoming webpages and projects because it makes it easier for the user to find specific information and have the information seperated so its not all conence into one really lon page.</p>
