                    <p>For my project, I made a website about electrical engineering using HTML, CSS, and Github. I also used jekyll which is the tool I chose. I did reaserch on the hardware and of the software that was already in the world then I came up with some new inventions. I then put that into the website that I made.</p>

            <div class="row text-center">

            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="text-center">Reflection</h2>
                <p> This project was the culmination of all the codeing I have learned throught the year. We did research and organized them all throughout the year. We then had to choose a tool that we would use with the project. I chose Jekyll. Jekyll is a static website generator that you can use mardown text and jekyll will convert it into html code. Jekyll will also let you use layouts and includs so you dont need to type code over and over again. We also need to use Bootstrap and CSS to make the wesite look better. Some of the challenges I had were with time manegment. I didn't manage mt time at all and cunched the website to make it be done in one night. If i where to do this again i would stick to my plan tat I made and make sure that I spread out my time. Somthing else tht I learned from the project is that Google is your best friend. Wg=hen i didnt know somthing or forgothow to do it I would look it up and there would be videos and articles that would help you know how to do it.</p>
                <p>During the project we had to use a Blog to document out thinking<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h9hdguxJGgkkhINwGMqoPxqm5w61aOTus1BdnNTd8cA/edit" target="_blank"> this</a> is the link if you would like to look at it.</p>
